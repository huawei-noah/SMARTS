Visualization
=============

Envision
--------

SMARTS includes a front-end visualization tool called *Envision* that provides real-time view of the environment state.
Envision is built on web-technologies (including `React <https://reactjs.org/>`_, `WebGL <https://www.khronos.org/webgl/>`_, and `websockets <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API>`_) allowing it to run easily in the browser. 
It is composed of a few parts: a client which SMARTS uses directly; a server used for state broadcasting; and the web application where all the visualization and rendering happens.

Run
^^^

An example is shown below to run SMARTS with Envision.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ cd <path>/SMARTS
    # Build scenarios/sumo/loop
    $ scl scenario build --clean scenarios/sumo/loop
    # Run the chase_via_points.py example with the loop scenario
    $ scl run --envision examples/control/chase_via_points.py scenarios/sumo/loop

``--envision`` flag is added to ``scl run`` to enable the Envision server. Visit `http://localhost:8081/ <http://localhost:8081/>`_ in your browser to see the environment visualization. Select the simulator instance in the top left dropdown. If you are using SMARTS on a remote machine you will need to forward port 8081.

Data Recording and Replay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For recording, simply feed ``envision_record_data_replay_path`` with desired recording output path in ``gym.make(...)``.

.. code-block:: python

    env = gym.make(
        "smarts.env:hiway-v0",
        scenarios=args.scenarios,
        agents={AGENT_ID: agent},
        headless=args.headless,
        envision_record_data_replay_path="./data_replay",
    )

Currently Envision server needs to be up for data recording to work. Hence, run SMARTS with Envision, such as ``scl run --envision <examples/example.py> <scenarios/scenario>``.

For replay, ensure Envision server is running, then use the following tool - passing in the replay files.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Here, the recorded file directory is ./data_replay/1590892375a
    $ scl scenario replay -d ./data_replay/1590892375a -t 0.1

    INFO:root:Replaying 1 record(s) at path=data_replay/1590892375a with timestep=0.1s

Development
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
    This section is only for those interested in editing or developing Envision.

To contribute to Envision it is easiest to start and control the processes manually. Start the Envision server by running

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd <path>/SMARTS
    # Runs on port 8081 by default
    $ python3 envision/server.py --debug

Then start the Envision web application. This requires npm (version >= 6) and node (version >= 12).

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd envision/web
    # Install dependencies
    $ npm install
    # Build, run dev server, and watch code changes
    $ npm run watch

This development flow currently requires reloading the webpage after any updates.

Save an updated distribution if any changes were made to the Envision web application.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd envision/web
    # Saves to envision/web/dist
    $ npm run build

Visdom
------

Use the `Visdom <https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom>`_ integration to easily see the image-based observation outputs in real-time. 
Start the visdom server before running the scenario and open the server URL in your browser `http://localhost:8097 <http://localhost:8097>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install visdom
    $ pip install visdom
    # Start the server
    $ visdom

Enable Visdom in the SMARTS environment by setting ``visdom=True``. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    env = gym.make(
        "smarts.env:hiway-v0", # env entry name
        ...
        visdom=True, # whether or not to enable visdom visualization (see Appendix).
        ...
    )

Below is a sample visualization of an agent's camera sensor observations.
