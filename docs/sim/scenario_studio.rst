Scenario Studio
===============

The Scenario Studio ``sstudio`` of SMARTS is a stand alone package :mod:`~smarts.sstudio` that supports flexible and expressive scenario specification. The ``sstudio`` domain specific language (DSL) has a simple ontology defined by :mod:`~smarts.sstudio.types` to help express your scenario needs in SMARTS.

A scenario is formed by combining several inputs, such as (i) road map, (ii) traffic, (iii) social agents, (iv) ego agents, (v) bubbles, (vi) friction patches, and (vii) traffic histories. Refer to :class:`~smarts.sstudio.types.Scenario`.

SMARTS interacts with road maps abstractly (polymorphically) through the :class:`~smarts.core.road_map.RoadMap` interface in order to support multiple map formats and allow for extending to support new map formats.

SMARTS ships with a variety of pre-configured scenarios, which can be found in ``SMARTS/scenarios`` and ``SMARTS/smarts/scenarios`` directories.

A typical scenario creation workflow is as follows.

1. Create a new scenario folder, preferably under ``SMARTS/scenarios`` directory, and create a new ``scenario.py`` file in the new folder.
2. Design the map.

   * For a SUMO road network, create the map using `netedit <https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/NETEDIT.html>`_ and save it in the new scenario folder.
   * For other road networks, define and instantiate a :class:`~smarts.sstudio.types.MapSpec` object in ``scenario.py``. Pass the ``MapSpec`` object to :class:`~smarts.sstudio.types.Scenario` in ``scenario.py``.

3. Add traffic, social agents, ego agents, friction patches, map spec, etc, to :class:`~smarts.sstudio.types.Scenario` in ``scenario.py``.
4. Feed the created :class:`~smarts.sstudio.types.Scenario` object to :func:`~smarts.sstudio.genscenario.gen_scenario` in ``scenario.py`` to generate the scenario. 

   .. code:: python

      from smarts.sstudio import types as t
      from smarts.sstudio import gen_scenario
      
      gen_scenario(
        scenario=t.Scenario(...),
        output_dir=Path(__file__).parent,
      )

5. Finally, build the scenario by running

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cd <path>/SMARTS
      $ scl scenario build-all <path>/<new_scenario_folder>

Following sections below explain how to handle and edit (i) traffic, (ii) social agents, (iii) ego agents, (iv) friction patches, and (v) road maps, in ``scenario.py`` file. Bubbles are explained at :ref:`bubbles`.

Traffic
-------

A minimal ``scenario.py`` instantiating a :class:`~smarts.sstudio.types.Traffic` object.

.. literalinclude:: ./minimal_scenario_studio.py
   :language: python

Simply run the ``scenario.py`` file as a regular Python script to generate the scenario.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3.8 scenarios/scenario.py

Traffic vehicles are controlled by either ``SUMO`` or ``SMARTS`` engine. Defaults to ``engine="SUMO"``. ``engine="SUMO"`` can only be used on SUMO road networks. For other map types use ``engine="SMARTS"``.

:class:`~smarts.sstudio.types.Flow` is used to generate repeated vehicle runs on the same route. Vehicle route, departure rate, and behaviour, can be configured here.

The example above simply uses a random route ``route=RandomRoute()``. A more specific route may be used such as :python:`Route(begin=("gneE72", 0, "random"), end=("edge2", 1, "max"))` which defines the edge id, lane id, and offset into the lane, to designate the start and end vehicle positions.

:class:`~smarts.sstudio.types.TrafficActor` is used to specify a spec for traffic actors (e.g. Vehicles, Pedestrians, etc). The defaults provided are for a car.
Acceleration, deceleration, speed distribution, imperfection distribution, and other configurations, can be specified for the traffic.

When :func:`~smarts.sstudio.genscenario.gen_scenario` is executed, a dir named "traffic" will be created under ``output_dir`` which contains background vehicle and route definitions.

.. important::
    If you want to train a policy on one scenario, remember to set the ``end`` time of :class:`~smarts.sstudio.types.Flow` larger or equal to your expected training time, since SMARTS will continue the flow after each ``reset`` call. 
    
    However, if there are multiple scenarios to train for one worker, you can relax this restriction since after the scenario change, the flow will also be reset to the beginning time.

Social agents
-------------

Social agents are controlled by (pre-trained) policies from the agent zoo (see :mod:`~zoo.policies`).

Scenarios can reference remote packages or local zoo agent packages by including a ``requirements.txt`` file in the root of the scenario folder. These additional packages will be installed when the scenario is built.

A minimal example defining social agent with extra dependencies is shown here. In the ``requirements.txt`` file:

.. code-block::

    --extra-index-url http://localhost:8080
    <dependency>==1.0.0
    rl-agent==1.0.0

Then in the ``scenario.py`` file:

.. code-block:: python

    from smarts.sstudio import types as t
    from smarts.sstudio import gen_scenario

    social_actor = t.SocialAgentActor(
        name="my-rl-agent",
        agent_locator="rl_agent:rl_agent-v1"
    )
    social_mission = t.Mission(route=t.RandomRoute())
    gen_scenario(
        scenario=t.Scenario(
            social_agent_missions={
                "general": ([social_actor], [social_mission])
            },
            ...
        )
    )

Ego missions
------------

Scenario Studio also allows generation of *missions* for ego agents to complete. When :func:`~smarts.sstudio.genscenario.gen_scenario` is executed, ``missions.rou.xml`` file will be created in the output dir.

.. code-block:: python

    from smarts.sstudio import types as t
    from smarts.sstudio import gen_scenario

    ego_missions = [
        t.Mission(
            route=t.Route(
                begin=("edge0", 0, "random"), 
                end=("edge1", 0, "max"),
            ),
        ),
    ]
    gen_scenario(
        scenario=t.Scenario(
            ego_missions=ego_missions,
            ...
        )
    )

.. caution::

    The "correctness" of traffic and missions is partially the user's responsibility. Specifically, ensuring that the start positions of ego vehicle mission routes and social vehicle traffic routes don't overlap is not handled by the scenario studio ``sstudio``. If they were to overlap, a collision will be immediately detected and the episode will end.

Friction patches
----------------

The Scenario Studio of SMARTS also allows the generation of *friction patches* which consists of a list of *surface patches* for ego agents and social agents. These surface patches uses :class:`~smarts.sstudio.types.PositionalZone` as in the case of bubbles. When we run :func:`~smarts.sstudio.genscenario.gen_scenario` passing in ``friction_maps``, a "friction_map.pkl" file will be created under the output dir.

.. code-block:: python

    from smarts.sstudio import types as t
    from smarts.sstudio import gen_scenario

    friction_patches = [
        t.RoadSurfacePatch(
            zone=t.PositionalZone(pos=(153, -100), size=(2000, 6000)),
            begin_time=0,
            end_time=20,
            friction_coefficient=0.5,
        ),
    ]
    gen_scenario(
        scenario=t.Scenario(
            friction_maps = friction_patches,
            ...
        )
    )

Road map
--------

SMARTS was initially designed to use maps in the SUMO road network format; it supports these natively.
However, SMARTS ``>=v0.5`` supports other custom map formats, as long as a class that implements the :class:`~smarts.core.road_map.RoadMap` interface is provided to read the custom map format.
Current support of custom map formats:

+ :class:`~smarts.core.opendrive_road_network.OpenDriveRoadNetwork` supports the use of `OpenDRIVE map format <https://www.asam.net/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=f&f=4089&token=deea5d707e2d0edeeb4fccd544a973de4bc46a09>`_.
+ :class:`~smarts.core.waymo_map.WaymoMap` supports the use of Waymo map format.

Create a custom map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If not utilizing a built-in map type (i.e., SUMO, OpenDRIVE, or Waymo map),
define a ``MapSpec`` object in your ``scenario.py``.

.. code-block:: python

    # Function that can create custom map objects using a map_spec
    def custom_map_builder(map_spec):
        # ...
        return map_object, map_hash

    map_spec = MapSpec(source="path_or_uri", builder_fn=custom_map_builder)


Convert an existing map to SUMO
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have a suitable file in another format, you can turn it into a SUMO road network using the :mod:`~smarts.sstudio.sumo2mesh` conversion utility.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 -m smarts.sstudio.sumo2mesh dataset_public/2lane_sharp/map.net.xml dataset_public/2lane_sharp/map.glb --format=glb
    $ python3 -m smarts.sstudio.sumo2mesh dataset_public/2lane_sharp/map.net.xml dataset_public/2lane_sharp/map.egg --format=egg


Create a SUMO map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Design map using SUMO's `netedit <https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/NETEDIT.html>`_ and export it in a ``map.net.xml`` format.
First, start ``netedit``.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ netedit

On the top left bar, "file" -> "new network" to create a new map.

Use shortcut key "e" to change to edge mode. Click "chain" and "two-way" icons located on the far right of top tool bar, shown in the image below:

.. image:: ../_static/chain_two_way.png

Then click on map to start creating new edges and lanes.

Note that SMARTS prefers to have "internal links" (connections) as part of any Junctions.
You can enable these by going to "Processing" -> "Options", choosing the "Junctions" section, and then making sure the "no-internal-links" checkbox is *unchecked*.

Edit an existing SUMO map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

"file" -> "Open Network..." to open an existing map.

Click on the inspect icon to enable inspect mode

.. image:: ../_static/inspect.png

Click on any edge to inspect detail and modify properties.

.. image:: ../_static/map_lane.png

The selected block is an edge with id "gneE72". It contains 3 lanes with lane index 0, 1, 2.

To modify the properties, for example change the number of lanes to 2 lanes by changing 3 to 2 on the "numLanes" field, and press "enter" to make the change. Then press "ctrl+s" to save. Finally, make sure to rebuild the scenario.

.. code-block:: bash

    scl scenario build --clean <path/to/scenario/folder>

To create custom connections between edges, first click the following icon on top bar.

.. image:: ../_static/connection_icon.png

The first lane you select would be the source lane, highlighted in blue. Then select other lanes as target lanes to connect to.
