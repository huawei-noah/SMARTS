To setup the simulator, which is called SMARTS, run the following commands,

.. code-block:: bash

    # git clone ...
    cd <project>

    # Follow the instructions given by prompt for setting up the SUMO_HOME environment variable
    ./install_deps.sh

    # verify sumo is >= 1.5.0

    sumo

    # setup virtual environment; presently only Python 3.7.x is officially supported
    python3.7 -m venv .venv

    # enter virtual environment to install all dependencies
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # upgrade pip, a recent version of pip is needed for the version of tensorflow we depend on
    pip install --upgrade pip

    # install [train] version of python package with the rllib dependencies
    pip install -e .[train]

    # make sure you can run tests (and verify they are passing)
    make test

    # then you can run a scenario, see following section for more details
