    .. code-block:: bash

        $ git checkout master

.. code-block:: bash

    # For Mac OS X users, ensure XQuartz is pre-installed.
    # Install the system requirements. You may use the `-y` option to enable
    # automatic assumption of "yes" to all prompts to avoid timeout from 
    # waiting for user input. 
    $ bash utils/setup/install_deps.sh

    # Setup virtual environment. Presently at least Python 3.8 and higher is
    # officially supported.
    $ python3.8 -m venv .venv

    # Enter virtual environment to install dependencies.
    $ source .venv/bin/activate

    # Upgrade pip.
    $ pip install --upgrade pip

    # Install smarts with extras as needed. Extras include the following: 
    # `camera_obs` - needed for rendering camera observations, and for testing.
    # `test` - needed for testing.
    # `train` - needed for RL training and testing.
    $ pip install -e '.[camera_obs,test,train]'

    # Run sanity-test and verify they are passing.
    # If tests fail, check './sanity_test_result.xml' for test report. 
    $ make sanity-test
