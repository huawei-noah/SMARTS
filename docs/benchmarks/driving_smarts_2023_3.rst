Driving SMARTS 2023.3
=====================

Objective
---------

Objective is to develop a single-ego policy capable of controlling a single ego to perform a platooning task in the 
``platoon-v0`` environment. Refer to :func:`~smarts.env.gymnasium.platoon_env.platoon_env` for environment details. 

.. important::

    In a scenario with multiple egos, a single-ego policy is replicated into every agent. Each agent is stepped
    independently by calling their respective :attr:`~smarts.core.agent.Agent.act` function. In short, multiple
    policies are executed in a distributed manner. The single-ego policy should be capable of accounting for and 
    interacting with other ego vehicles, if any are present.

Each ego is supposed to track and follow its specified leader (i.e., lead vehicle) in a single file or in a 
platoon fashion. The name identifier of the lead vehicle to be followed is given to the ego through the configuration
of the :attr:`~smarts.core.agent_interface.ActorsAliveDoneCriteria.actors_of_interest` attribute.

.. figure:: ../_static/driving_smarts_2023/vehicle_following.png

    Here, egos are in red colour, lead vehicle is in blue colour, and background traffic is in silver colour. 
    (Left) At the start of episode, egos start tracking the lead vehicle. (Right) After a while, egos follow the
    lead vehicle in a single-file fashion.

An ego is terminated when its assigned leader reaches the leader's destination. Egos do not have prior knowledge of 
the assigned leader's destination.

Any method such as reinforcement learning, offline reinforcement learning, behaviour cloning, generative models,
predictive models, etc, may be used to develop the policy.

Several scenarios are provided for training. Their names and tasks are as follows. 
The desired task execution is illustrated in a gif by a trained baseline agent. 

+ straight_2lane_agents_1
    A single ego must follow a specified leader, with no background traffic.

Observation space
-----------------

The underlying environment returns formatted :class:`~smarts.core.observations.Observation` using 
:attr:`~smarts.env.utils.observation_conversion.ObservationOptions.multi_agent`
option as observation at each time point. See 
:class:`~smarts.env.utils.observation_conversion.ObservationSpacesFormatter` for
a sample formatted observation data structure.

Action space
------------

Action space for each ego is :attr:`~smarts.core.controllers.ActionSpaceType.Continuous`.

Code structure
--------------

Users are free to use any training method and any folder structure for training the policy.

Only the inference code is required for evaluation, and therefore it must follow the folder 
structure and contain specified file contents, as explained below. The below files and folders
must be present with identical names. Any additional files may be optionally added by 
the user.

1. inference/contrib_policy/__init__.py
    + Keep this file unchanged.
    + It is an empty file.

                agent_params=agent_params,
            )

        register(locator="contrib-agent-v0", entry_point=entry_point)

    + User may fill in the ``<...>`` spaces in the template.
    + User may specify the ego's interface by configuring any field of :class:`~smarts.core.agent_interface.AgentInterface`, except
        
      + :attr:`~smarts.core.agent_interface.AgentInterface.accelerometer`,

4. inference/MANIFEST.in 
    + Contains any file paths to be included in the package.

5. inference/setup.cfg
    + Must contain the following template code. 
    + The template code helps build the user policy into a Python package.
