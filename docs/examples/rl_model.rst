=========

These examples demonstrate some ways to use SMARTS to generate RL models.


#. Driving SMARTS Drive

    + directory: :examples:`e10_drive`
    + This example was developed in conjunction with the :ref:`Driving SMARTS 2023.1 & 2023.2 <driving_smarts_2023_1>` benchmark, hence refer to it for details.


#. Driving SMARTS Platoon

    + directory: :examples:`e11_platoon`
    + This example was developed in conjunction with the :ref:`Driving SMARTS 2023.3 <driving_smarts_2023_3>` benchmark, hence refer to it for details.


#. RLlib

    + directory: :examples:`e12_rllib`
    + See the :ref:`RLlib integration <rllib>` for additional examples.
