## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Added an actor capture manager interface, `ActorCaptureManager`, which describes a manager that handles the change of control of actors. Operations in an actor manager step should not cause conflict in the simulation.
- Added a new entry tactic, `IdEntryTactic`, which provides the scenario the ability to select a specific actor for an agent to take over.
- Registered a new `chase-via-points-agent-v0` agent in agent zoo, which can effectively chase via points across different road sections by using the waypoints.
- Added new driving-smarts-v2023 benchmark consisting of new (i) driving-smarts-v2023 env and (ii) platoon-v0 env.
- Added baseline example, consisting of training, inference, and zoo agent registration, for the platooning task in Driving SMARTS 2023.3 benchmark.
- Documented the challenge objective, desired inference code structure, and use of baseline example, for Driving SMARTS 2023.3 benchmark, i.e., platooning task.
- Added a new scenario consisting of merge-exit map, sumo lead vehicle, and traffic, for the vehicle-following task.
- Explained in the docs that agents may spawn at different times in multiagent scenarios.
### Changed
- The trap manager, `TrapManager`, is now a subclass of `ActorCaptureManager`.

### Security

## [0.7.0rc0] 2022-10-31
### Added
- Added a basic background traffic ("social vehicle") provider as an alternative to the SUMO traffic simulator.  This can be selected using the new `"engine"` argument to `Traffic` in Scenario Studio.
- Added a `multi-scenario-v0` environment which can build any of the following scenario, namely, `1_to_2lane_left_turn_c`, `1_to_2lane_left_turn_t`, `3lane_merge_multi_agent`, `3lane_merge_single_agent`, `3lane_cruise_multi_agent`, `3lane_cruise_single_agent`, `3lane_cut_in`, and `3lane_overtake`. Additional scenarios can also be built by supplying the paths to the scenario directories.

- Added option to `AgentInterface` to include traffic signals (lights) in `EgoVehicleObservation` objects.
- Added the ability to hover over vehicles and roadmap elements in Envision to see debug info.

### Deprecated
- Deprecated a few things related to traffic in the `Scenario` class, including the `route` argument to the `Scenario` initializer, the `route`, `route_filepath` and `route_files_enabled` properties, and the `discover_routes()` static method.  In general, the notion of "route" (singular) here is being replaced with "`traffic_specs`" (plural) that allow for specifying traffic controlled by the SMARTS engine as well as Sumo.
- `waymo_browser.py` has been deprecated in favour of the scl waymo command line tools.

### Changed
- Add `lane_offset` to `Waypoint` class and `lane_postion` to both `EgoVehicleObservation` and `VehicleObservation` classes to expose the reference-line (a.k.a. Frenet) coordinate system.
- Traffic history vehicles can now be hijacked within a bubble.  They will be relinquished to the SMARTS background traffic provider upon exiting the bubble.
- Changed the name of the `Imitation` action space to `Direct`.
- Removed `endless_traffic` option from `SumoTrafficSimulator` and instead added `repeat_route` to `Flow` type in Scenario Studio.
- Renamed `examples/observation_collection_for_imitation_learning.py` to `examples/traffic_histories_to_observations.py`.
- Renamed `examples/history_vehicles_replacement_for_imitation_learning.py` to `examples/traffic_histories_vehicle_replacement.py`.
- `SumoTrafficSimulation` will now try to hand-off the vehicles it controls to the new SMARTS background traffic provider by default if the Sumo provider crashes.
- SMARTS now gives an error about a suspected lack of junction edges in sumo maps on loading of them.
- Scenario build artifacts are now cached and built incrementally, meaning that subsequent builds (without the `clean` option) will only build the artifacts that depend on the changed DSL objects
- All build artifacts are now in a local `build/` directory in each scenario's directory
- The `allow_offset_map` option has been removed. This must now be set in a `MapSpec` object in the scenario.py if this option is needed
- All scenarios must have a `scenario.py`, and must call `gen_scenario()`, rather than the individual `gen_` functions, which are now private

### Removed
- Removed support for deprecated json-based and YAML formats for traffic histories.
- Removed time and distance to collision values from `FormatObs` wrapper as the current implementation's correctness was in doubt.

### Fixed
- Fixed bug where `yaw_rate` was always reported as 0.0 (Issue #1481).
- Modified `FrameStack` wrapper to support agents which start at a later time in the simulation.
- Truncated all waypoint paths returned by `FormatObs` wrapper to be of the same length. Previously, variable waypoint-path lengths caused inhomogenous shape error in numpy array.
- Fixed a bug where traffic providers would leak across instances due to the ~~(awful design decision of python)~~ reference types defaults in arguments sharing across instances.
- Fixed minor bugs causing some Waymo maps not to load properly.
- Fixed a bug where `Vehicle.bounding_box` was mirrored over Y causing on shoulder events to fire inappropriately.
- Fixed an issue where the ego and neighbour vehicle observation was returning `None` for the nearby `lane_id`, `lane_index`, and `road_id`. These now default to constants `off_lane`, `-1`, and `off_road` respectively.
- Fixed a bug where bubble agents would stick around and to try to get observations even after being disassociated from a vehicle.
- Fixed a bug with the `TripMeterSensor` that was not using a unit direction vector to calculate trip distance against current route.
- Fixed issues with Envision. The playback bar and realtime mode now work as expected.
- Fixed a bug where traffic history vehicles would not get traffic signal observations
- Fixed a bug where envision would not work in some versions of python due to nuances of `importlib.resource.path()`.
- Fixed an issue with incorrect vehicle sizes in Envision.

## [0.6.1] 2022-08-02
### Added
- Added standard intersection environment, `intersection-v0`, for reinforcement learning where agents have to make an unprotected left turn in the presence of traffic.

  - `EPISODE_REQUIRED`: Needed for the current episode. Results in episode ending if it should recover but cannot or should not recover.
  - `EXPERIMENT_REQUIRED`: Needed for the experiment. Results in exception if it should recover but cannot or should not recover.
  - `ATTEMPT_RECOVERY`: Provider should attempt to recover from the exception or disconnection.
- Added recovery options for providers in `smarts.core.provider.Provider`. These include:
  - Add `recover()` method to providers to attempt to recover from errors and disconnection.
  - Add `connected` property to providers to check if the provider is still connected.
- Added recovery options to `smarts.core.smarts.SMARTS.add_provider()`
  - Add `recovery_flags` argument to configure the recovery options if the provider disconnects or throws an exception.
- Added `driving_in_traffic` reinforcement learning example. An ego agent is trained using DreamerV2 to drive as far and as fast as possible in heavy traffic, without colliding or going off-road.
- Added `smarts.core.smarts.SMARTSDestroyedError` which describes use of a destroyed `SMARTS` instance.
### Changed
- `test-requirements` github action job renamed to `check-requirements-change` and only checks for requirements changes without failing.
- Moved examples tests to `examples` and used relative imports to fix a module collision with `aiohttp`'s `examples` module.
- Made changes to log sections of the scenario step in `smarts.py` to help evaluate smarts performance problems. See Issue #661.
- Introducted `RoadMap` class to abstract away from `SumoRoadNetwork`
  and allow for (eventually) supporting other map formats.  See Issue #830 and PR #1048.
  This had multiple cascading ripple effects (especially on Waypoint generation and caching,
  Missions/Plans/Routes and road/lane-related sensors).  These include:
    - Removed the `AgentBehavior` class and the `agent_behavior` parameter to `AgentInterface`.
    - Moved the definition of `Waypoint` from `smarts.core.mission_planner` to `smarts.core.road_map`.
    - Moved the definition of `Mission` and `Goal` classes from `smarts.core.scenario` to `smarts.core.plan`.
    - Added `MapSpec` to the SStudio DSL types and introduced a simple builder pattern for creating `RoadMap` objects.
- Changed the type hint for `EgoVehicleObservation`: it returns a numpy array (and always has).
- Raised a warning message for building scenarios without `map.net.xml` file. See PR #1161.
- Updated `smarts/env/hiway_env.py` to support `OpenDRIVE` maps so that the `SMARTS` object is instantiated without the `SUMO` traffic provider and social agents. See PR #1215.
- Public `SMARTS` methods will throw `smarts.core.smarts.SMARTSDestroyedError` if `SMARTS.destroy()` has previously been called on the `SMARTS` instance.
### Fixed
- Fix lane vector for the unique cases of lane offset >= lane's length. See PR #1173.
- Logic fixes to the `_snap_internal_holes` and `_snap_external_holes` methods in `smarts.core.sumo_road_network.py` for crude geometry holes of sumo road map. Re-adjusted the entry position of vehicles in `smarts.sstudio.genhistories.py` to avoid false positive events. See PR #992.
- Prevent `test_notebook.ipynb` cells from timing out by increasing time to unlimited using `/metadata/execution/timeout=65536` within the notebook for regular uses, and `pytest` call with `--nb-exec-timeout 65536` option for tests. See for more details: "https://jupyterbook.org/content/execute.html#setting-execution-timeout" and "https://pytest-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/tutorial_intro.html#pytest-fixture".
- Stop `multiprocessing.queues.Queue` from throwing an error by importing `multiprocessing.queues` in `envision/utils/multiprocessing_queue.py`.
- Prevent vehicle insertion on top of ignored social vehicles when the `TrapManager` defaults to emitting a vehicle for the ego to control. See PR #1043
- Prevent `TrapManager`from trapping vehicles in Bubble airlocks.  See Issue #1064.
- Social-agent-buffer is instantiated only if the scenario requires social agents
- Mapped Polygon object output of Route.geometry() to sequence of coordinates.
- Updated deprecated Shapely functionality.
- Fixed the type of `position` (pose) fields emitted to envision to match the existing type hints of `tuple`.
- Properly detect whether waypoint is present in mission route, while computing distance travelled by agents with missions in TripMeterSensor.
- Fixed `test_notebook` timeout by setting `pytest --nb-exec-timeout 65536`.
### Deprecated
- The `timestep_sec` property of SMARTS is being deprecated in favor of `fixed_timesep_sec`
  for clarity since we are adding the ability to have variable time steps.
### Removed
- Remove `ray_multi_instance` example when running `make sanity-test`
- Removed deprecated fields from `AgentSpec`:  `policy_builder`, `policy_params`, and `perform_self_test`.
- Removed deprecated class `AgentPolicy` from `agent.py`.
- Removed `route_waypoints` attribute from `smarts.core.sensors.RoadWaypoints`.

### Added
- Added `sanity-test` script and asked new users to run `sanity-test` instead of `make test` to ease the setup
process
- Added `on_shoulder` as part of events in observation returned from each step of simulation
- Added description of map creation and how to modify the map to allow users to create their own traffic routes in docs

- Added glb models for pedestrians and motorcycles
- Added `near realtime` mode and `uncapped` mode in Envision
- Added `--allow-offset-map` option for `scl scenario build` to prevent auto-shifting of Sumo road networks
- Added options in `DoneCriteria` to trigger ego agent to be done based on other agent's done situation
### Changed
- Refactored SMARTS class to not inherit from Panda3D's ShowBase; it's aggregated instead. See issue #597.
- Updated imitation learning examples.
### Fixed
- Fixed the bug of events such as off_road not registering in observation when off_road is set to false in DoneCriteria
- Fixed Sumo road network offset bug for shifted maps.  See issue #716.

- Fixed bugs in traffic history and changed interface to it.  See issue #732.
- Update `ego_open_agent` to use the package instead of the zoo directory version.
- Quieted error logs generated by failed Envision connections as well as noisy pybullet log messages.  See issue #819.
- Removed all coverage files created during make test. See issue #826.
- Removed scenarios and examples modules from pip installation. See issue #833.

## [0.4.15] - 2021-03-18
### Added
- This CHANGELOG as a change log to help keep track of changes in the SMARTS project that can get easily lost.
- Hosted Documentation on `readthedocs` and pointed to the smarts paper and useful parts of the documentation in the README.
- Running imitation learning will now create a cached `history_mission.pkl` file in scenario folder that stores
the missions for all agents.
- Added ijson as a dependency.
- Added `cached-property` as a dependency.
### Changed
- Lowered CPU cost of waypoint generation. This will result in a small increase in memory usage.
- Set the number of processes used in `make test` to ignore 2 CPUs if possible.
- Use the dummy OpEn agent (open-agent version 0.0.0) for all examples.
- Improved performance by removing unused traffic light functionality.
- Limit the memory use of traffic histories by incrementally loading the traffic history file with a worker process.
### Fixed
- In order to avoid precision issues in our coordinates with big floating point numbers, we now initially shift road networks (maps) that are offset back to the origin using [netconvert](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/netconvert.html). We adapt Sumo vehicle positions to take this into account to allow Sumo to continue using the original coordinate system.  See Issue #325. This fix will require all scenarios to be rebuilt (`scl scenario build-all --clean ./scenarios`).
- Cleanly close down the traffic history provider thread. See PR #665.
- Improved the disposal of a SMARTS instance. See issue #378.
- Envision now resumes from current frame after un-pausing.
- Skipped generation of cut-in waypoints if they are further off-road than SMARTS currently supports to avoid process crash.
- Fix envision error 15 by cleanly shutting down the envision worker process.
