## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Added `get_vehicle_start_time()` method for scenarios with traffic history data.  See Issue #1210.
- Added `FormatObs` wrapper which converts SMARTS observations to gym-compliant RL-friendly vectorized observations and returns `StdObs`.
- Added `Pose.as_position2d()` method which converts the pose to an [x,y] position array.
- Added `EventConfiguration` dataclass in the agent interface to allow users to configure the conditions in which events are triggered
- Extended the `RoadMap` API to support `Waymo` map format in `smarts/core/waymo_msp.py`.
### Changed
- If more than one qualifying map file exists in a the `map_spec.source` folder, `get_road_map()` in `default_map_builder.py` will prefer to return the default files (`map.net.xml` or `map.xodr`) if they exist.
- Moved the `smarts_ros` ROS node from the `examples` area into the `smarts.ros` module so that it can be distributed with SMARTS packages.
- Use `Process` to replace `Thread` to speed up the `scl scenario build-all --clean <scenario_dir>` runtime.
### Deprecated
### Fixed
- Fixed a secondary exception that the `SumoTrafficSimulation` will throw when attempting to close a TraCI connection that is closed by an error.
- Ensure that `smarts.core.coordinates.Pose` attribute `position` is an [x, y, z] numpy array, and attribute `orientation` is a quaternion length 4 numpy array. 
- Update social vehicle pose in Bullet when no active agents are present.
### Removed
- Removed the unconditional import of `Renderer` from `smarts/core/vehicle.py` to make `Panda3D` optional dependency regression. See Issue #1310.

## [0.5.0] - 2022-01-07
### Added
- Added Minimum FrameRate tests to measure the fps for `smart.step()` method. See Issue #455.
- Added a ROS wrapper/driver example to wrap SMARTS in a ROS (v1) node.
- Added the ability to pass an optional `time_delta_since_last_step` to SMARTS' `step()` function
  to support variable timesteps for co-simulation.
- Added `step_count` and `elapsed_sim_time` to the `Observation` class.  See PR #974 and Issues #884 and #918.
- Added `dt` to `Observation` class to inform users of the observations of the variable timestep.
- Added the ability to externally update SMARTS state via a new privileged-access `ExternalProvider`.
- Allow specifying "-latest" as a version suffix for zoo locator strings.
- Added Base CI and dependencies requirement tests for the "darwin" platform (MacOS).
- Extended Imitation Learning codebase to allow importing traffic histories from the Waymo motion dataset and replay in a SMARTS simulation. See PR #1060.
- Added options for dealing with noise when inferring headings while importing traffic history data.  See PR #1219.
- Added `ros` extension rule to `setup.py`.
- Added a script to allow users to hijack history vehicles dynamically through a trigger event. See PR #1088.
- Added a `-y` option to `utils/setup/install_deps.sh` to accept installation by default. See issue #1081.
- Added `ParallelEnv` class and a corresponding example to simulate multiple SMARTS environments in parallel, with synchronous or asynchronous episodes.
- Added `smarts.core.utils.import_utils` to help with the dynamic import of modules.
- Added `single_agent` env wrapper and unit test. The wrapper converts a single-agent SMARTS environment's step and reset output to be compliant with gym spaces.
- Added `rgb_image` env wrapper and unit test. The wrapper filters SMARTS environment observation and returns only top-down RGB image as observation.
- Extended the `RoadMap` API to support `OpenDRIVE` map format in `smarts/core/opendrive_road_network.py`. Added 3 new scenarios with `OpenDRIVE` maps. See PR #1186.
- Added a "ReplayAgent" wrapper to allow users to rerun an agent previously run by saving its configurations and inputs. See Issue #971.
- Added `smarts.core.provider.ProviderRecoveryFlags` as flags to determine how `SMARTS` should handle failures in providers. They are as follows:
  - `NOT_REQUIRED`: Not needed for the current step. Error causes skip of provider if it should recover but cannot or should not recover.
  - `EPISODE_REQUIRED`: Needed for the current episode. Results in episode ending if it should recover but cannot or should not recover.
  - `EXPERIMENT_REQUIRED`: Needed for the experiment. Results in exception if it should recover but cannot or should not recover.
  - `ATTEMPT_RECOVERY`: Provider should attempt to recover from the exception or disconnection.
- Added recovery options for providers in `smarts.core.provider.Provider`. These include:
  - Add `recover()` method to providers to attempt to recover from errors and disconnection.
  - Add `connected` property to providers to check if the provider is still connected.
- Added recovery options to `smarts.core.smarts.SMARTS.add_provider()`
  - Add `recovery_flags` argument to configure the recovery options if the provider disconnects or throws an exception.
- Added `driving_in_traffic` reinforcement learning example. An ego agent is trained using DreamerV2 to drive as far and as fast as possible in heavy traffic, without colliding or going off-road.
- Added `smarts.core.smarts.SMARTSDestroyedError` which describes use of a destroyed `SMARTS` instance.
### Changed
- `test-requirements` github action job renamed to `check-requirements-change` and only checks for requirements changes without failing.
- Moved examples tests to `examples` and used relative imports to fix a module collision with `aiohttp`'s `examples` module.
- Made changes to log sections of the scenario step in `smarts.py` to help evaluate smarts performance problems. See Issue #661.
- Introducted `RoadMap` class to abstract away from `SumoRoadNetwork`
  and allow for (eventually) supporting other map formats.  See Issue #830 and PR #1048.
  This had multiple cascading ripple effects (especially on Waypoint generation and caching,
  Missions/Plans/Routes and road/lane-related sensors).  These include:
    - Removed the `AgentBehavior` class and the `agent_behavior` parameter to `AgentInterface`.
    - Moved the definition of `Waypoint` from `smarts.core.mission_planner` to `smarts.core.road_map`.
    - Moved the definition of `Mission` and `Goal` classes from `smarts.core.scenario` to `smarts.core.plan`.
    - Added `MapSpec` to the SStudio DSL types and introduced a simple builder pattern for creating `RoadMap` objects.
- Changed the type hint for `EgoVehicleObservation`: it returns a numpy array (and always has).
- Raised a warning message for building scenarios without `map.net.xml` file. See PR #1161.
- Updated `smarts/env/hiway_env.py` to support `OpenDRIVE` maps so that the `SMARTS` object is instantiated without the `SUMO` traffic provider and social agents. See PR #1215.
- Public `SMARTS` methods will throw `smarts.core.smarts.SMARTSDestroyedError` if `SMARTS.destroy()` has previously been called on the `SMARTS` instance.
### Fixed
- Fix lane vector for the unique cases of lane offset >= lane's length. See PR #1173.
- Logic fixes to the `_snap_internal_holes` and `_snap_external_holes` methods in `smarts.core.sumo_road_network.py` for crude geometry holes of sumo road map. Re-adjusted the entry position of vehicles in `smarts.sstudio.genhistories.py` to avoid false positive events. See PR #992.
- Prevent `test_notebook.ipynb` cells from timing out by increasing time to unlimited using `/metadata/execution/timeout=65536` within the notebook for regular uses, and `pytest` call with `--nb-exec-timeout 65536` option for tests. See for more details: "https://jupyterbook.org/content/execute.html#setting-execution-timeout" and "https://pytest-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/tutorial_intro.html#pytest-fixture".
- Stop `multiprocessing.queues.Queue` from throwing an error by importing `multiprocessing.queues` in `envision/utils/multiprocessing_queue.py`.
- Prevent vehicle insertion on top of ignored social vehicles when the `TrapManager` defaults to emitting a vehicle for the ego to control. See PR #1043
- Prevent `TrapManager`from trapping vehicles in Bubble airlocks.  See Issue #1064.
- Social-agent-buffer is instantiated only if the scenario requires social agents
- Mapped Polygon object output of Route.geometry() to sequence of coordinates.
- Updated deprecated Shapely functionality.
- Fixed the type of `position` (pose) fields emitted to envision to match the existing type hints of `tuple`.
- Properly detect whether waypoint is present in mission route, while computing distance travelled by agents with missions in TripMeterSensor.
- Fixed `test_notebook` timeout by setting `pytest --nb-exec-timeout 65536`.
### Deprecated
- The `timestep_sec` property of SMARTS is being deprecated in favor of `fixed_timesep_sec`
  for clarity since we are adding the ability to have variable time steps.
### Removed
- Remove `ray_multi_instance` example when running `make sanity-test`
- Removed deprecated fields from `AgentSpec`:  `policy_builder`, `policy_params`, and `perform_self_test`.
- Removed deprecated class `AgentPolicy` from `agent.py`.
- Removed `route_waypoints` attribute from `smarts.core.sensors.RoadWaypoints`.

### Fixed
- Suppress messages in docker containers from missing `/dev/input` folder.
- When code runs on headless machine, panda3d will fallback to using `p3headlessgl` option to render images without requiring X11.

process
- Added `on_shoulder` as part of events in observation returned from each step of simulation
- Added description of map creation and how to modify the map to allow users to create their own traffic routes in docs

- Added glb models for pedestrians and motorcycles
- Added `near realtime` mode and `uncapped` mode in Envision
- Added `--allow-offset-map` option for `scl scenario build` to prevent auto-shifting of Sumo road networks
- Added options in `DoneCriteria` to trigger ego agent to be done based on other agent's done situation

- Fixed bugs in traffic history and changed interface to it.  See issue #732.
- Update `ego_open_agent` to use the package instead of the zoo directory version.
- Quieted error logs generated by failed Envision connections as well as noisy pybullet log messages.  See issue #819.
- Removed all coverage files created during make test. See issue #826.
- Removed scenarios and examples modules from pip installation. See issue #833.

## [0.4.15] - 2021-03-18
### Added
- This CHANGELOG as a change log to help keep track of changes in the SMARTS project that can get easily lost.
- Hosted Documentation on `readthedocs` and pointed to the smarts paper and useful parts of the documentation in the README.
- Running imitation learning will now create a cached `history_mission.pkl` file in scenario folder that stores
the missions for all agents.
- Added ijson as a dependency.
- Added `cached-property` as a dependency.
### Changed
- Lowered CPU cost of waypoint generation. This will result in a small increase in memory usage.
- Set the number of processes used in `make test` to ignore 2 CPUs if possible.
- Use the dummy OpEn agent (open-agent version 0.0.0) for all examples.
- Improved performance by removing unused traffic light functionality.
- Limit the memory use of traffic histories by incrementally loading the traffic history file with a worker process.
### Fixed
- In order to avoid precision issues in our coordinates with big floating point numbers, we now initially shift road networks (maps) that are offset back to the origin using [netconvert](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/netconvert.html). We adapt Sumo vehicle positions to take this into account to allow Sumo to continue using the original coordinate system.  See Issue #325. This fix will require all scenarios to be rebuilt (`scl scenario build-all --clean ./scenarios`).
- Cleanly close down the traffic history provider thread. See PR #665.
- Improved the disposal of a SMARTS instance. See issue #378.
- Envision now resumes from current frame after un-pausing.
- Skipped generation of cut-in waypoints if they are further off-road than SMARTS currently supports to avoid process crash.
- Fix envision error 15 by cleanly shutting down the envision worker process.
