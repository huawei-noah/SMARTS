# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This changelog is to adhere to the format given at [keepachangelog](keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) 
and should maintain [semantic versioning](semver.org).

All text added must be human readable. 

Copy and pasting the git commit messages is __NOT__ enough.

## [Unreleased]
### Added 
- Added `sanity-test` script and asked new users to run `sanity-test` instead of `make test` to ease the setup
process
- Added `on_shoulder` as part of events in observation returned from each step of simulation
- Added description of map creation and how to modify the map to allow users to create their own traffic routes in docs
- Added reference to SMARTS paper in front page of docs
- Only create `Renderer` on demand if vehicles are using camera-based sensors. See issue #725.
- Added glb models for pedestrians and motorcycles
- Added `near realtime` mode and `uncapped` mode in Envision
- Added `--allow-offset-map` option for `scl scenario build` to prevent auto-shifting of Sumo road networks
- Added options in `DoneCriteria` to trigger ego agent to be done based on other agent's done situation
### Changed
- Refactored SMARTS class to not inherit from Panda3D's ShowBase; it's aggregated instead. See issue #597.
### Fixed
- Fixed the bug of events such as off_road not registering in observation when off_road is set to false in DoneCriteria
- Fixed Sumo road network offset bug for shifted maps.  See issue #716.
- Fixed traffic generation offset bug for shifted maps.  See issue #790.
- Fixed bugs in traffic history and changed interface to it.  See issue #732.
- Update `ego_open_agent` to use the package instead of the zoo directory version.
- Quieted error logs generated by failed Envision connections as well as noisy pybullet log messages.  See issue #819.

## [0.4.15] - 2021-03-18
### Added
- This CHANGELOG as a change log to help keep track of changes in the SMARTS project that can get easily lost.
- Hosted Documentation on `readthedocs` and pointed to the smarts paper and useful parts of the documentation in the README.
- Running imitation learning will now create a cached `history_mission.pkl` file in scenario folder that stores 
the missions for all agents.
- Added ijson as a dependency. 
- Added `cached_property` as a dependency.
### Changed
- Lowered CPU cost of waypoint generation. This will result in a small increase in memory usage.
- Set the number of processes used in `make test` to ignore 2 CPUs if possible.
- Use the dummy OpEn agent (open-agent version 0.0.0) for all examples.
- Improved performance by removing unused traffic light functionality.
- Limit the memory use of traffic histories by incrementally loading the traffic history file with a worker process.
### Fixed
- In order to avoid precision issues in our coordinates with big floating point numbers,
we now initially shift road networks (maps) that are offset back to the origin
using [netconvert](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/netconvert.html).
We adapt Sumo vehicle positions to take this into account to allow Sumo to continue
using the original coordinate system.  See Issue #325.
    - This fix will require all Scenarios to be rebuilt (`scl scenario build-all --clean ./scenarios`).
- Cleanly close down the traffic history provider thread. See PR #665.
- Improved the disposal of a SMARTS instance. See issue #378.
- Envision now resumes from current frame after un-pausing.
- Skipped generation of cut-in waypoints if they are further off-road than SMARTS currently supports to avoid process crash.
- Fix envision error 15 by cleanly shutting down the envision worker process.
