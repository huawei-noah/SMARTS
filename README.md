SMARTS (Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Training School) is a simulation platform for multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and research on autonomous driving. Its focus is on realistic and diverse interactions. It is part of the [XingTian](https://github.com/huawei-noah/xingtian/) suite of RL platforms from Huawei Noah's Ark Lab.
