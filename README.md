SMARTS (Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Training School) is a simulation platform for multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and research on autonomous driving. Its focus is on realistic and diverse interactions. It is part of the [XingTian](https://github.com/huawei-noah/xingtian/) suite of RL platforms from Huawei Noah's Ark Lab.

# Documentation
:rotating_light: :bell: Read the docs :notebook_with_decorative_cover: at [smarts.readthedocs.io](https://smarts.readthedocs.io/) . :bell: :rotating_light:

# Setup and Quickstart
1. [Set up SMARTS](https://smarts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html).
2. [Run a simple experiment](https://smarts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html).

# Examples 
### Egoless
Simulate a SMARTS environment without any ego agents, but with only background traffic.
1. [Egoless](examples/egoless.py) example.

### Control Theory
Several agent control policies and agent [action types](smarts/core/controllers/__init__.py) are demonstrated.

1. Chase Via Points
   + script: [control/chase_via_points.py](examples/control/chase_via_points.py)
   + Multi agent
   + ActionSpaceType: LaneWithContinuousSpeed
1. Trajectory Tracking
   + script: [control/trajectory_tracking.py](examples/control/trajectory_tracking.py)
   + ActionSpaceType: Trajectory
1. OpEn Adaptive Control
   + script: [control/ego_open_agent.py](examples/control/ego_open_agent.py)
   + ActionSpaceType: MPC
1. Laner
   + script: [control/laner.py](examples/control/laner.py)
   + Multi agent
   + ActionSpaceType: Lane
1. Parallel environments
   + script: [control/parallel_environment.py](examples/control/parallel_environment.py)
   + Multiple SMARTS environments in parallel
   + ActionSpaceType: LaneWithContinuousSpeed

### RL Model
1. [Intersection](examples/rl/intersection) using PPO from [Stable Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3).

### RL Environment
1. [ULTRA](https://github.com/smarts-project/smarts-project.rl/blob/master/ultra) provides a gym-based environment built upon SMARTS to tackle intersection navigation, specifically the unprotected left turn.
