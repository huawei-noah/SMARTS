SMARTS (Scalable Multi-Agent RL Training School) is a simulation platform for reinforcement learning and multi-agent research on autonomous driving. Its focus is on realistic and diverse interactions. It is part of the [XingTian](https://github.com/huawei-noah/xingtian/) suite of RL platforms from Huawei Noah's Ark Lab.

## Multi-Agent experiment as simple as...

```python
import gym

from smarts.core.agent_interface import AgentInterface, AgentType
from smarts.core.agent import AgentSpec, Agent

class SimpleAgent(Agent):
    def act(self, obs):
        return "keep_lane"

agent_spec = AgentSpec(
    interface=AgentInterface.from_type(AgentType.Laner, max_episode_steps=None),
    agent_builder=SimpleAgent,
)

agent_specs = {
    "Agent-007": agent_spec,
    "Agent-008": agent_spec,
}

env = gym.make(
    "smarts.env:hiway-v0",
    scenarios=["scenarios/loop"],
    agent_specs=agent_specs,
)

agents = {
    agent_id: agent_spec.build_agent()
    for agent_id, agent_spec in agent_specs.items()
}
observations = env.reset()

for _ in range(1000):
    agent_actions = {
        agent_id: agents[agent_id].act(agent_obs)
        for agent_id, agent_obs in observations.items()
    }
    observations, _, _, _ = env.step(agent_actions)
```

## Setup

```bash
# For Mac OS X users, make sure XQuartz is pre-installed as SUMO's dependency

# git clone ...
cd <project>

# Follow the instructions given by prompt for setting up the SUMO_HOME environment variable
./install_deps.sh

# verify sumo is >= 1.5.0
# if you have issues see ./doc/SUMO_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
sumo

# setup virtual environment; presently only Python 3.7.x is officially supported
python3.7 -m venv .venv

# enter virtual environment to install all dependencies
source .venv/bin/activate

# upgrade pip, a recent version of pip is needed for the version of tensorflow we depend on
pip install --upgrade pip

# install [train] version of python package with the rllib dependencies
pip install -e .[train]

# make sure you can run tests (and verify they are passing)
pip install -e .[test]
make test

# then you can run a scenario, see following section for more details
```

## Running

We use [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/introduction.html) to run SMARTS together with it's supporting processes. To run the default example simply build a scenario and start supervisord:

```bash
# build scenarios/loop
scl scenario build --clean scenarios/loop

# start supervisord
supervisord
```

With `supervisord` running, visit http://localhost:8081/ in your browser to view your experiment.

See [./envision/README.md](./envision/README.md) for more information on Envision, our front-end visualization tool.

Several example scripts are provided under [`SMARTS/examples`](./examples), as well as a handful of scenarios under [`SMARTS/scenarios`](./scenarios). You can create your own scenarios using the [Scenario Studio](./smarts/sstudio). Here's how you can use one of the example scripts with a scenario.

```bash
# Update the command=... in ./supervisord.conf
#
# [program:smarts]
# command=python examples/single_agent.py scenarios/loop
# ...
```

## CLI tool

SMARTS provides a command-line tool to interact with scenario studio and Envision.

Usage
```
scl COMMAND SUBCOMMAND [OPTIONS] [ARGS]...
```

Commands:
* envision
* scenario
* zoo

Subcommands of scenario:
* build-all: Generate all scenarios under the given directories
* build: Generate a single scenario
* clean: Clean generated artifacts

Subcommands of envision:
* start: start envision server

Subcommands of zoo:
* zoo: Build an agent, used for submitting to the agent-zoo

### Examples:

```
# Start envision, serve scenario assets out of ./scenarios
scl envision start --scenarios ./scenarios

# Build all scenario under given directories
scl scenario build-all ./scenarios ./eval_scenarios

# Rebuild a single scenario, replacing any existing generated assets
scl scenario build --clean scenarios/loop

# Clean generated scenario artifacts
scl scenario clean scenarios/loop
```

## Interfacing with Gym

See the provided ready-to-go scripts under the [examples/](./examples) directory.

## Contributing

Please read [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Building Docs Locally

Assuming you have run `pip install .[dev]`.

```bash
make docs

python -m http.server -d docs/_build/html
# Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Extras

### Visualizing Agent Observations
If you want to easily visualize observations you can use our [Visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom) integration. Start the visdom server before running your scenario,

```bash
visdom
# Open the printed URL in your browser
```

And in your experiment, start your environment with `visdom=True`

```python
env = gym.make(
    "smarts.env:hiway-v0",
    scenarios=["scenarios/loop"],
    agent_specs=agent_specs,
    visdom=True,
)
```

### Interfacing w/ PyMARL and malib

[PyMARL](https://github.com/oxwhirl/pymarl) and [malib](https://github.com/ying-wen/malib) have been open-sourced. You can run them via,

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ying-wen/pymarl.git

ln -s your-project/scenarios ./pymarl/scenarios

cd pymarl

# setup virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python src/main.py --config=qmix --env-config=smarts
```

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ying-wen/malib.git

ln -s your-project/scenarios ./malib/scenarios

cd malib

# setup virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python examples/run_smarts.py --algo SAC --scenario ./scenarios/loop --n_agents 5
```

### Using Docker

If you're comfortable using docker or are on a platform without suitable support to easily run SMARTS (e.g. an older version of Ubuntu) you can run the following,

```bash
$ cd /path/to/SMARTS
$ docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/src -p 8081:8081 huaweinoah/smarts:<version>
# E.g. docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/src -p 8081:8081 huaweinoah/smarts:v0.4.12
# <press enter>

# Run Envision server in the background
# This will only need to be run if you want visualisation
$ scl envision start -s ./scenarios -p 8081 &

# Build an example
# This needs to be done the first time and after changes to the example
$ scl scenario build scenarios/loop --clean

# Run an example
# add --headless if you do not need visualisation
$ python examples/single_agent.py scenarios/loop

# On your host machine visit http://localhost:8081 to see the running simulation in
# Envision.
```

(For those who have permissions:) if you want to push new images to our [public dockerhub registry](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/huaweinoah) run,

```bash
# For this to work, your account needs to be added to the huaweinoah org
docker login

export VERSION=v0.4.3-pre
docker build -t smarts:$VERSION .
docker tag smarts:$VERSION huaweinoah/smarts:$VERSION
docker push huaweinoah/smarts:$VERSION
```

### Troubleshooting

#### General
In many cases additinal run logs are located at '~/.smarts'. These can sometimes be helpful.

#### SUMO
SUMO can have some problems in setup. Please look through the following for support for SUMO:
* If you are having issues see: **[SETUP](docs/setup.rst)** and **[SUMO TROUBLESHOOTING](docs/SUMO_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**
* If you wish to find binaries: **[SUMO Download Page](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Downloads.php)**
* If you wish to compile from source see: **[SUMO Build Instructions](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Developer/Main.html#build_instructions)**. 
    * **Please note that building SUMO may not install other vital dependencies that SUMO requires to run.**
    * If you build from the git repository we recommend you use: **[SUMO version 1.7.0](https://github.com/eclipse/sumo/commits/v1_7_0)** or higher
