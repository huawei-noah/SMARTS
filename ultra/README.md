# ULTRA

## Unprotected Left Turn using Reinforcement-learning Agents

Ultra provides a gym-based environment using SMARTS for tackling intersection navigation and more specifically unprotected left turn.

Here is the summary of key features:
 - Creating customized scenarios with different levels of difficulty.
 - Defining and analyzing traffic designs including low-mid-high densities.
 - Defining and analyzing social-vehicle behaviors.
 - Configurable train and test parameters.
 - Train and test custom RL algorithms against benchmark results.
