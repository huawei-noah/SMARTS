<h2>Code</h2>
(a) Use python3.8 to develop your model.<br>
(b) All necessary code for the competition is provided at <code>SMARTS/competition/</code> directory in branch <code>comp-1</code> of the <a href="https://github.com/huawei-noah/SMARTS/tree/comp-1">SMARTS repository</a>.<br>
(c) Install SMARTS package from <code>comp-1</code> branch as:
<pre><code>
$ pip install "smarts[camera-obs] @ git+https://github.com/huawei-noah/SMARTS.git@comp-1"
</code></pre>
(d) To obtain the entire code, run the following:
<pre><code>
$ git clone https://github.com/huawei-noah/SMARTS.git
$ git checkout comp-1
$ cd &lt;path&gt;/SMARTS/competition    
</code></pre>

<h2>Validation</h2>
(a) Since Track-1 and Track-2 has limited number of submissions, a Validation stage is made available.<br>
(b) Participants may submit their zipped Track-1 and Track-2 code to Validation stage, to check whether their code executes without errors.<br>
(c) Scores will not be revealed in this stage.<br>

<h2>Track-1</h2>
(a) Objective is to train a single policy capable of controlling single-agent 
    or multi-agent to complete different driving tasks in various scenarios.<br> 
(b) Any method such as reinforcement learning, offline reinforcement learning,
    behaviour cloning, generative models, predictive models, etc, may be used
    to develop the policy.<br>
(b) For more instructions and explanations, see the accompanying <code>README.md</code> file of each stage.<br>

        <li>Evaluation: <code>/SMARTS/competition/evaluation/README.md</code></li>
    </ul>

<h2>Track-2: Offline Learning</h2>
(a) Objective is to train a single policy capable of controlling single-agent 
    or multi-agent to complete different driving tasks in various scenarios.<br> 
(b) An <b>offline</b> learning method using offline datasets must be used to
    develop the policy.<br>
(c) For more instructions and explanations, see the accompanying <code>README.md</code> file of each stage.<br>
