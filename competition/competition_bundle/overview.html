<h1>Overview</h1>

<h2>The Competition</h2>
<p>
    Autonomous driving (AD) is the next frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
    Intending to further research in AD, we invite you to participate in an autonomous driving 
    competition organised by Huawei Technologies Ltd. and academic collaborators.
</p>

<h2>Tasks and Evaluation</h2>
<p>
    This competition seeks to advance autonomous driving by developing agents that can drive as 
    quickly and safely as possible from the start to destination amid background traffic. Data 
    for the competition are mined from large-scale naturalistic driving data, manipulated, and 
    replayed in <a href="https://github.com/huawei-noah/SMARTS/tree/comp-1">SMARTS</a> simulation environment. 
    The following typical driving scenarios are tested: cruising, overtaking, merging, left turns 
    at unsignalized intersections and being cut off by another vehicle. For some scenarios, 
    interactive background vehicles are added in SMARTS.
</p>
<p>
    Agents will be ranked according to their task completion (i.e., % of completed scenarios), completion 
    time (e.g., time steps taken to complete scenario), human-likeness (e.g., jerkiness, acceleration, 
    and distance to surrounding vehicles, etc), and safety (e.g., traffic rule violations).
</p>

<h2>Competition Tracks</h2>
<p><strong>Validation Stage</strong>: This stage is to validate that your submission will work without errors during Track1 and Track2 evaluation.</p> 
<p>There are two competition tracks.</p>
<p><strong>Track 1</strong>: The participants may use&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;method to develop their solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Track 2</strong>: The participants are only allowed to train their models on&nbsp;<em>offline datasets</em>.</p>
