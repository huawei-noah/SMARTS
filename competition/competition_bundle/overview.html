<h1>Overview</h1>

<h2><a href="https://smarts-project.github.io/#the-competition">The Competition</a></h2>
<p>
    Autonomous driving (AD) is the next frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
    Intending to further research in AD, we invite you to participate in an autonomous driving 
    competition organised by Huawei Technologies Ltd. and academic collaborators.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://smarts-project.github.io/#tasks-and-evaluation">Tasks and Evaluation</a></h2>
<p>
    This competition seeks to advance autonomous driving by developing agents that can drive as 
    quickly and safely as possible from the start to destination amid background traffic. Data 
    for the competition are mined from large-scale naturalistic driving data, manipulated, and 
    replayed in <a href="https://github.com/huawei-noah/SMARTS">SMARTS</a> simulation environment. 
    The following typical driving scenarios are tested: cruising, overtaking, merging, left turns 
    at unsignalized intersections and being cut off by another vehicle. For some scenarios, 
    interactive background vehicles are added in SMARTS.
</p>
<p>
    Agents will be ranked according to their task completion (i.e., % of completed scenarios), completion 
    time (e.g., time steps taken to complete scenario), human-likeness (e.g., jerkiness, acceleration, 
    and distance to surrounding vehicles, etc), and safety (e.g., traffic rule violations).
</p>

<h2><a href="https://smarts-project.github.io/#competition-tracks">Competition Tracks</a></h2>
<p>There are two tracks in the competition.<br>
    <strong>Track 1</strong>: The participants may use&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;method to develop their solutions.<br>
    <strong>Track 2</strong>: The participants are only allowed to train their models on&nbsp;<em>offline datasets</em>.<br>
    <br>
    Winners in each track will receive cash prizes and will get a chance to present their innovative solutions during the virtual ceremony.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://smarts-project.github.io/#prizes">Prizes</a></h2>
Top participants in <strong>each track</strong> will receive the following prizes:<br>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Gold</strong>&nbsp;US$6000</li>
    <li><strong>Silver</strong>&nbsp;US$4000</li>
    <li><strong>Bronze</strong>&nbsp;US$2000</li>
</ul>
Additional prizes:<br>
<ul>
    <li>US$1000 for the&nbsp;<strong>most innovative</strong>&nbsp;approach out of top-6 entries in both tracks.</li>
    <li>US$1000 given to one of the valid submissions not in top-3 positions in either track.</li>
</ul>

    </blockquote>

<h2>Code</h2>
(a) Use python3.8 to develop your model.<br>
(b) All necessary code for the competition is provided at <code>SMARTS/competition/</code> directory in branch <code>comp-1</code> of the <a href="https://github.com/huawei-noah/SMARTS/tree/comp-1">SMARTS repository</a>.<br>
(c) Install SMARTS package from <code>comp-1</code> branch as:<br>
<pre><code>$ pip install "smarts[camera-obs] @ git+https://github.com/huawei-noah/SMARTS.git@comp-1"
</code></pre>
(d) To obtain the base code, run the following:<br>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/huawei-noah/SMARTS.git
$ git checkout comp-1
$ cd &lt;path&gt;/SMARTS/competition    
</code></pre>

<h2>Extended Environment "bubble_env"</h2>
(a) An additional evaluation environment is available and it is used as part of the evaluation.<br>
(b) It can be acquired in a few ways. The easiest way is to install it through <code>pip</code>.<br>
<pre><code>$ pip install "bubble_env @ git+https://malban@bitbucket.org/malban/bubble_env.git"</code></pre>
(c) To directly obtain the additional environment and resources you may instead do the following:<br>
<pre><code>$ cd &lt;path&gt;
$ git clone https://malban@bitbucket.org/malban/bubble_env.git
$ cd bubble_env
$ git lfs pull # or follow instructions in ./README.md
$ pip install -e .
$ cd &lt;path&gt;/SMARTS/competition 
</code></pre>

<h2>Validation</h2>
(a) Since Track-1 and Track-2 has limited number of submissions, a Validation stage is made available.<br>
(b) Participants may submit their zipped Track-1 and Track-2 code to Validation stage, to check whether their code executes without errors.<br>
(c) Scores will not be revealed in this stage.<br>

<h2>Track-1</h2>
(a) Objective is to train a single policy capable of controlling single-agent 
    or multi-agent to complete different driving tasks in various scenarios.<br> 
(b) Any method such as reinforcement learning, offline reinforcement learning,
    behaviour cloning, generative models, predictive models, etc, may be used
    to develop the policy.<br>
(b) For more instructions and explanations, see the accompanying <code>README.md</code> file of each stage.<br>       
    <ul>
        <li>Training: <code>/SMARTS/competition/track1/train/README.md</code></li>
        <li>Submission: <code>/SMARTS/competition/track1/submission/README.md</code></li>
        <li>Evaluation: <code>/SMARTS/competition/evaluation/README.md</code></li>
    </ul>

<h2>Track-2: Offline Learning</h2>
(a) Objective is to train a single policy capable of controlling single-agent 
    or multi-agent to complete different driving tasks in various scenarios.<br> 
(b) An <b>offline</b> learning method using offline datasets must be used to
    develop the policy.<br>
(c) For more instructions and explanations, see the accompanying <code>README.md</code> file of each stage.<br>
