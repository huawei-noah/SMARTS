    # When inferring headings from positions, each vehicle's angular velocity
    # will be limited to be at most this amount (in rad/sec) to prevent lateral-coordinate
    # noise in the dataset from causing near-instantaneous heading changes.

    # When inferring headings from positions, a sliding window (moving average)
    # of this size will be used to smooth inferred headings and reduce their dependency

    # Speed threshold below which a vehicle's heading is assumed not to change.
    # This is useful to prevent abnormal heading changes that may arise from
    # noise in position estimates in a trajectory dataset dominating real position
    # changes in situations where the real position changes are very small.
